Pebble Watchface that takes ques from Android's Lockscreen

This watchface provides weather updates as well as bluetooth connection and battery status. In order to receive weather updates you need to have a forecast.io API key (https://developer.forecast.io/). The API key can be set in the watchface's configuration page through the main Pebble application, as well as weather display type (F/C) and refresh rates.
